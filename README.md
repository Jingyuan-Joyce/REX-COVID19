# Description

We use different models to predict the number of new cases of COVID-19 in British Columbia using features based on the number of tweets that included the hashtag #COVID19, and keywords related to the symptoms of this disease. We use two different datasets; the second of the two is a version of the first which was expanded through the application of word2vec. We obtain the lowest validation error with a Ridge regression with the first set of features as predictors.
